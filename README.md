ipv4index
=========

IPv4 address index for fast insert/query/delete/merge/diff operations

IPv4 addresses are everywhere, in Netflow records, PCAP files, log files etc.

In this project some code experiments are done to do

- insert IPv4 addresses in an index
- query a set of IPv4 addresses of an index
- delete a set of  IPv4 addresses of an index
- merge two or more  indices
- extract the difference of IPv4 addresses of two or more indices
