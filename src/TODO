TODO write tests for each functions
TODO put metadata on top of shared memory segment as this area is not addressable
in 32bit mode
TODO Instead of having a complex program nf-bitindex create multiple small programs
TODO write multiple sources (netflow, pcap, binary IP list, dotted decimal IP list)
TODO dump local/shared memory segments
TODO Implement set functions union, intersection, diff
TODO Check a list of IP addresses -> bulk check to reduce IO
TODO While going through a source update multiple bitindexes at the same time
     to avoid reprocessing
